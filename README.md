# my-sweet-app

A demonstration of including an Earth Engine App in a custom page as an iframe.

By default, my sweet Earth Engine App has a default URL:<br>
https://jstnbraaten.users.earthengine.app/view/eo-timeseries-explorer

But I can wrap it in this page with an iframe:<br>
https://jdbcode.github.io/my-sweet-app/

See this file for iframe useage:<br>
